## Goal
#### Take in two CFG's which represent families of RNA and compare the models to determine similarity of RNA families. 


## Questions for Us

#### 1) What is the constraint that a covariance model places upon a scfg. 
#### 2) Is a covariance model identical to a Visually Pushdown Automata (IE Can we use work on both?)
#### 3) 


## Questions for Zhong

#### 1) Clarify that we are only trying to accomplish the same thing that HHSEARCH does (comparing two models) but we aren't using HMMS
#### 2) Is he aware of current methods to do SCFG to SCFG distance comparison (I think the answer is no)
#### 3) Do we care about comparing the content of the rna sequences or only their secondary structures (shapes).
