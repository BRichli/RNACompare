## Goal
#### Take in two CFG's which represent families of RNA and compare the models to determine similarity of RNA families. 


## Questions
#### 1) What is the constraint that a covariance model places upon a scfg. 
#### 2) Is a covariance model identical to a Visually Pushdown Automata (IE Can we use work on both?)
#### 3)
