## Goal
#### Take in two CFG's which represent families of RNA and compare the models to determine similarity of RNA families. 


## Questions for Us

#### 1) What is the constraint that a covariance model places upon a scfg. 
#### 2) Is a covariance model identical to a Visually Pushdown Automata (IE Can we use work on both?) (Bryan)
#### 3) 


## Questions for Zhong

#### 1) Clarify that we are only trying to accomplish the same thing that HHSEARCH does (comparing two models) but we aren't using HMMS
#### 2) Is he aware of current methods to do SCFG to SCFG distance comparison (I think the answer is no), if this turns out to be too challenging may we resort to the HMM-HMM comparison.  
#### 3) Do we care about comparing the content of the rna sequences or only their secondary structures (shapes). 
#### 4) Can we instead of comparing languages, compare grammars as an approximation of language similarity.
